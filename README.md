# IdleMinerAutomator
**This program automatically sends commands to the Discord window.**

Edit: If you dont know how to compile this and wanna just download the exe, make sure to be in channel called **"hello"**, or the program wont work.
This is done, because We dont wanna the program spam in random channels.

**Before starting the program, please make sure that ;f, ;h, ;wings & ;rage have no cooldowns, or the bot will be delayed.**

**What this program does:**
  - Sends **;f, ;h, ;wings & ;rage** into chat every 5 minutes and 5 seconds.
  - Sends ;ca (claimall) into chat every 60 minutes and 5 seconds.
  - Sends ;s and ;up b/p a with random delay from 4 - 6 seconds, once all ";s" have been sent it will initiate 1 - 2 minutes delay.
  - Sends ;level and ;rebirth once the 1 - 2 minutes delay ends.
